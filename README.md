How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

        By creating the framewrok and features piece by piece it aallowed me to polish and refine each piece of the overall project. This made it so they were correct, worked well, and could eaisly be adapted to be used in another application. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

        I went point by point to see what the exact requirements were and ensured to include them without missing any. Doing so, also allowed me to work one by one and make them efficient and work to the best of my ability. In the future, I would also plan to follow these steps in future projects so that every piece of my work could be things I am confident in. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

        I feel one of our major purposes is to make labor-ish tasks much easier on a user. What I mean, is in this case finding animal candidates could take a long time scanning through the database line by line. But, computer scientists can create ways to increase efficiency and make these tasks quicker.
